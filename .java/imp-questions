## Restricting a class from creating multiple instances(Say 3)
   
   -- As we know using singleton we can restrict a class from creating multiple objects it will 
      create single object and share it.
   -- Same design pattern we can apply here with an counter
   -- It will take a static variable counter to check how many objects created
   -- As we can access static variables in constructor and static variables are class level we 
      can use static variable to count number of object created.
   
 public RestrictInstance{						
 static int objCount;
 static RestrictInstance object;
 
 RestrictInstance(){
 System.out.println("Constructor called");
 objCount++;
 }
 
 public Object getInstance(){
 if(objCount < 3){
   object = new RestrictInstance();
	}
	 return object;
  }
 }
