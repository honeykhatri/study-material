1. What is Apache Kafka?
Sample Answer:

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows producers to publish messages to topics, and consumers to subscribe to those topics and process the messages in real time.

2. What are the main components of Kafka?
Sample Answer:

The main components of Kafka are:

Producer: Sends data to Kafka topics.
Consumer: Reads data from topics.
Broker: A Kafka server that stores and serves messages.
Topic: A category or feed name to which records are published.
Zookeeper: Manages cluster metadata and leader election (optional in newer versions).
3. What is a Kafka topic?
Sample Answer:

A Kafka topic is a logical channel to which producers send messages and from which consumers read messages. Topics can have multiple partitions to allow parallel processing and scalability.

4. What is a Kafka partition and why is it important?
Sample Answer:

A partition is a subset of a topic. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple brokers and enabling parallel processing by consumers.

5. What is the role of Zookeeper in Kafka?
Sample Answer:

Zookeeper is used by Kafka to manage metadata, broker coordination, and leader election. However, newer versions of Kafka (2.8 and above) support running without Zookeeper using KRaft mode.

6. What is the difference between a Kafka producer and a consumer?
Sample Answer:

A producer sends messages to Kafka topics, while a consumer subscribes to topics and processes the messages. Producers push data into Kafka, and consumers pull data from Kafka.

7. How does Kafka ensure message durability?
Sample Answer:

Kafka ensures durability by writing messages to disk and replicating them across multiple brokers. A message is considered durable once it is written to the leader and acknowledged by the in-sync replicas.

8. What is the difference between Kafka and traditional messaging systems like RabbitMQ?
Sample Answer:

Kafka is designed for high-throughput, distributed, and real-time event streaming. It stores messages for a configurable retention period, allowing multiple consumers to read at their own pace. Traditional systems like RabbitMQ focus more on message queuing and immediate delivery, often deleting messages once consumed.
