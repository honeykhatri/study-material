1. What is Apache Kafka?
Sample Answer:

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows producers to publish messages to topics, and consumers to subscribe to those topics and process the messages in real time.

2. What are the main components of Kafka?
Sample Answer:

The main components of Kafka are:

Producer: Sends data to Kafka topics.
Consumer: Reads data from topics.
Broker: A Kafka server that stores and serves messages.
Topic: A category or feed name to which records are published.
Zookeeper: Manages cluster metadata and leader election (optional in newer versions).
3. What is a Kafka topic?
Sample Answer:

A Kafka topic is a logical channel to which producers send messages and from which consumers read messages. Topics can have multiple partitions to allow parallel processing and scalability.

4. What is a Kafka partition and why is it important?
Sample Answer:

A partition is a subset of a topic. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records. Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple brokers and enabling parallel processing by consumers.

5. What is the role of Zookeeper in Kafka?
Sample Answer:

Zookeeper is used by Kafka to manage metadata, broker coordination, and leader election. However, newer versions of Kafka (2.8 and above) support running without Zookeeper using KRaft mode.

6. What is the difference between a Kafka producer and a consumer?
Sample Answer:

A producer sends messages to Kafka topics, while a consumer subscribes to topics and processes the messages. Producers push data into Kafka, and consumers pull data from Kafka.

7. How does Kafka ensure message durability?
Sample Answer:

Kafka ensures durability by writing messages to disk and replicating them across multiple brokers. A message is considered durable once it is written to the leader and acknowledged by the in-sync replicas.

8. What is the difference between Kafka and traditional messaging systems like RabbitMQ?
Sample Answer:

Kafka is designed for high-throughput, distributed, and real-time event streaming. It stores messages for a configurable retention period, allowing multiple consumers to read at their own pace. Traditional systems like RabbitMQ focus more on message queuing and immediate delivery, often deleting messages once consumed.


ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate-Level Kafka Interview Questions & Answers
1. How does Kafka achieve high throughput and low latency?
Sample Answer:

Kafka achieves high throughput and low latency through:

Sequential disk writes using a log-based storage model.
Batching of messages to reduce network overhead.
Zero-copy technology for fast data transfer.
Partitioning, which allows parallel processing across brokers and consumers.
2. What is a consumer group and how does it work?
Sample Answer:

A consumer group is a set of consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic. Each partition in a topic is assigned to only one consumer in the group, ensuring parallelism and avoiding duplicate processing. Kafka tracks the offset for each consumer group independently.

3. What is the difference between at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once delivery semantics?
Sample Answer:

At-most-once: Messages may be lost but never redelivered.
At-least-once: Messages are never lost but may be redelivered (duplicates possible).
Exactly-once: Each message is delivered and processed only once (no loss, no duplicates).
Kafka supports all three, with exactly-once requiring idempotent producers and transactional processing.

4. How does Kafka handle message ordering?
Sample Answer:

Kafka guarantees message ordering within a partition. If you need strict ordering, you should ensure that all related messages go to the same partition using a consistent key.

5. What is Kafka retention policy and how is it configured?
Sample Answer:

Kafka retains messages for a configurable period or until a size limit is reached, regardless of whether theyâ€™ve been consumed. This is controlled using:

retention.ms: Time-based retention
retention.bytes: Size-based retention
6. How does Kafka handle backpressure?
Sample Answer:

Kafka handles backpressure by allowing consumers to process messages at their own pace. If a consumer is slow, Kafka retains the messages based on the retention policy. However, if the consumer lags too much and messages expire, data loss can occur.

7. What is the role of Kafka offset and how is it managed?
Sample Answer:

An offset is a unique identifier for a message within a partition. Kafka uses offsets to track which messages have been consumed. Offsets can be:

Automatically committed (default)
Manually committed by the consumer for more control
8. How can you secure a Kafka cluster?
Sample Answer:

Kafka supports several security features:

Authentication: SASL or SSL
Authorization: ACLs to control access to topics
Encryption: SSL/TLS for data in transit
Audit logging: For tracking access and changes

ðŸ”´ Advanced-Level Kafka Interview Questions & Answers
1. Explain Kafkaâ€™s ISR (In-Sync Replicas) and how it affects availability.
Sample Answer:

ISR stands for In-Sync Replicas. Itâ€™s the set of replicas that are fully caught up with the leader. Kafka only acknowledges a write when itâ€™s written to all replicas in the ISR (depending on the acks setting). If the ISR shrinks (e.g., due to network issues), 
Kafka may stop acknowledging writes to maintain durability, which can affect availability.

2. What happens when a Kafka broker goes down?
Sample Answer:

When a broker goes down:

Its partitions become temporarily unavailable.
Kafka automatically elects a new leader for each affected partition from the ISR.
Producers and consumers are redirected to the new leader.
When the broker comes back, it re-syncs and rejoins the ISR.

3. How does Kafka handle leader election for partitions?
Sample Answer:

Kafka uses Zookeeper (or KRaft in newer versions) to manage leader election. Each partition has one leader and multiple followers. If the leader fails, a new leader is chosen from the ISR. The election is coordinated to ensure consistency and avoid split-brain scenarios.

4. What are Kafka Streams and how do they differ from Kafka Connect?
Sample Answer:

Kafka Streams is a Java library for building real-time stream processing applications. It allows you to transform, aggregate, and join data streams.
Kafka Connect is a tool for integrating Kafka with external systems (e.g., databases, file systems) using source and sink connectors.
In short: Kafka Streams is for processing, Kafka Connect is for integration.
5. How would you design a Kafka architecture for a high-throughput, fault-tolerant system?
Sample Answer:

Use multiple partitions per topic to enable parallelism.
Deploy multiple brokers for load distribution.
Enable replication (e.g., replication factor = 3) for fault tolerance.
Use acks=all and min.insync.replicas for durability.
Monitor with tools like Prometheus + Grafana.
Use Kafka Connect for ingestion and Kafka Streams for processing.
6. How do you monitor and tune Kafka performance?
Sample Answer:

Monitor metrics like consumer lag, broker disk usage, under-replicated partitions, and request latency.
Use tools like Confluent Control Center, Prometheus, or Burrow.
Tune parameters like:
batch.size, linger.ms (producer)
fetch.min.bytes, max.poll.records (consumer)
num.io.threads, num.network.threads (broker)
7. What are the trade-offs between increasing partitions vs. increasing consumers?
Sample Answer:

More partitions increase parallelism but also increase overhead (e.g., more open file handles, more metadata).
More consumers improve throughput only if there are enough partitions.
You need a balance: ideally, number of consumers â‰¤ number of partitions.
8. How does Kafka achieve exactly-once semantics with transactions?
Sample Answer:

Kafka supports exactly-once semantics (EOS) using:

Idempotent producers to avoid duplicate writes.
Transactions to group multiple writes into an atomic unit.
Transactional IDs to track producer sessions.
Consumers must use read_committed isolation level to avoid reading uncommitted data.
