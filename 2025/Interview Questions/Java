- What are the differences between == and .equals() in Java?
    - == compares object references (memory addresses).
    - .equals() compares object values, as defined by the class

            String a = new String("Hello");
            String b = new String("Hello");
            a == b;        // false
            a.equals(b);   // true


- What is the purpose of the final keyword?
    - Used to declare:
        - A final variable: cannot be reassigned.
        - A final method: cannot be overridden.
        - A final class: cannot be extended.
    - Encourages immutability and stability in code.


- Explain the concept of Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    - JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode.
    - Converts compiled .class files into machine code for execution.
    - It provides abstraction from hardware specifics and enables platform independence.


- How does garbage collection work in Java?
    - JVM periodically removes unreferenced objects from memory.
    - Uses algorithms like Mark-and-Sweep, Generational GC.
    - Developer hints GC via System.gc() but itâ€™s non-deterministic.

- What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
    | Feature        | ArrayList                     | LinkedList                  |
    |----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
    | Access speed   | Faster (index-based)          | Slower                      |
    | Insert/delete  | Slower (shifting elements)    | Faster (no shifting needed) |
    | Memory usage   | Less (contiguous)             | More (node pointers)        |
