Abstract Factory Pattern 

Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.

In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. 
Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.


    The main difference between a “factory method” and an “abstract factory” is that the factory method is a single method, and an abstract factory is an object.
    The factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass, whereas the abstract factory is an object that has multiple factory methods on it.
    The Factory Method pattern uses inheritance and relies on a subclass to handle the desired object instantiation.
