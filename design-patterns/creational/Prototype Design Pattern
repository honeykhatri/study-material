Prototype Design Pattern

Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.

The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations.
The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object.The newly copied object may change same properties only if required.
This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when the object creation is a heavy process.

 One of the best available way to create object from existing objects are clone() method. Clone is the simplest approach to implement prototype pattern. However,
 it is your call to decide how to copy existing object based on your business model.
 
 Prototype Design Participants

1) Prototype : This is the prototype of actual object.

2) Prototype registry : This is used as registry service to have all prototypes accessible using simple string parameters.

3) Client : Client will be responsible for using registry service to access prototype instances.
