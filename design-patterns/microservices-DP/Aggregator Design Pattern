Aggregator Design Pattern

      Aggregator micro service collects pieces of data from various micro services and returns the aggregate for processing.

      Aggregator Micro service invokes multiple services to achieve the functionality required by the application.
      
      This aggregating microservice acts as an intermediary service that is a composition of other microservices, in the sense that it calls the microservices,
      obtains the individual responses from each microservice, and applies the necessary business rule, returning the final response to the client.
