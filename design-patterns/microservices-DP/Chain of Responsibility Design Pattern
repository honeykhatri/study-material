 Chained or chain of responsibility
 
 
Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to 
process them.Later, the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to 
the next object in the chain or not.

This pattern is recommended when multiple objects can handle a request and the handler doesnâ€™t have to be a specific object. Also, the handler 
is determined at runtime. Please note that a request not handled at all by any handler is a valid use case.
