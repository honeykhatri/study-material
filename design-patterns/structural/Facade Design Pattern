Facade Design Pattern

It hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client from where the client can access the system.'

Eg:JDBC 
In Java, the interface JDBC can be called a facade because, we as users or clients create connection using the “java.sql.Connection” interface,
the implementation of which we are not concerned about. The implementation is left to the vendor of driver.
