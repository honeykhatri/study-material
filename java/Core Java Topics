CLASSLOADERS
https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-classloader-works-in-java.html#axzz59AWpr6cb

class loaders are used to load classes at runtime

ClassLoader in Java works on three principles: delegation, visibility, and uniqueness. 
Delegation principle forward request of class loading to parent class loader and only loads the class if the parent is not able to find or load the class. 
The visibility principle allows the child class loader to see all the classes loaded by the parent ClassLoader, but the parent class loader can not see classes 
loaded by a child. 
The uniqueness principle allows one to load a class exactly once, which is basically achieved by delegation and ensures that child ClassLoader doesn't reload the
class already loaded by a parent.
