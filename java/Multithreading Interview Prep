*** Thread Lifecycle & States
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW --> RUNNABLE --> RUNNING
           |           |
           v           v
       BLOCKED     WAITING / TIMED_WAITING
           \           /
            --> RUNNABLE --> TERMINATED

🧵 1. NEW
Description: The thread is created but not yet started.
Transition: Moves to RUNNABLE when start() is called.
🏃 2. RUNNABLE
Description: The thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
Transition:
Moves to RUNNING (internally) when the thread is picked by the scheduler.
Can move to BLOCKED, WAITING, or TIMED_WAITING depending on synchronization or wait conditions.
⛔ 3. BLOCKED
Description: The thread is waiting to acquire a lock held by another thread.
Transition: Moves back to RUNNABLE once the lock is available.
⏳ 4. WAITING
Description: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action (e.g., wait(), join() without timeout).
Transition: Moves to RUNNABLE when notified or the joined thread finishes.
⏱️ 5. TIMED_WAITING
Description: The thread is waiting for a specified amount of time (e.g., sleep(), join(timeout), wait(timeout)).
Transition: Moves to RUNNABLE after the time expires or the event occurs.
☠️ 6. TERMINATED
Description: The thread has completed execution or was terminated.
Transition: Final state — no further transitions.
