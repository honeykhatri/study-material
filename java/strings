Strings

Immutable in Java
Classes like StringBuilder and StringBuffer allow you to make string like Objects mutable.
StringBuffer is thread safe as there methods are synchornized.


From Java 9, Strings are stored as byte arrays instead of char arrays .. because of this Strngs now takes half the space.

There are 2 ways to create Strings 

1. String Literals
String A="abc";
String B="abc";
Live in String constant pool.
Strings A and B reference the same object and value.
A==B true
A.equals(B) true

2.String Objects
String A=new String("abc");
String B=new String("abc");
Live In the heap
String A and B reference to two separate objects
A==B will return false
A.equals(B) will return true;


== vs .equals
== compares the references 
.equals compares the value.
