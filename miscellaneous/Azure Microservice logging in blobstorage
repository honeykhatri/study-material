    App service configuration: While crating Web app with the following settings, Publish as Code, Runtime stack as Java 8 or version you are using and most 
    important Java web server stack as Java SE(Embedded Web Server). This configuration can also be changed from configuration blade from app service.

                                            


    Enable application logging in blob-storage in App service logs blade in App service. Application logging in filesystem is not needed.

                                         


    In Release pipeline for post deployment add inline script to delete the web.config file which is generated default.
    Also in our project we have changed the jar name of each file to app.jar, this is default name which Azure Web app expects.


Rename of application jar
archivesBaseName = 'app'


    After deployment when you hit the service with logging data, the logging data is stored in blob-storage.
