Azure - Day 3


Deploying SQL Server using IaaS
* Creating a  sql VM 
New -> Databases-> SQL server 2019 on Windows Server 2019 -> create
VM name -
No Infra redundancy
Eviction Policy - Stop
Size:ds1v2
Admin details 
Inbound ports : None
Vnet 
Boot diagnostics disable
SQL server settings : SQL connectivity : Public
(We can connect to this sql via local as well)
Port 1443
CREATE

Start the machine
Open Microsoft sql management studio on local
Server name : pass dns name of sql server
Authentication : SQL Authentication {Azure AD is preferred}
* Bastion: create bastion subnet
       Add subnet :azure bastion subnet(10.1.1.0/ 24)
       Create new public IP 
       BASTION configured
Connect using Bastion -> connect 
SQL Server configuration : Security - SQL Authentication (enable)-> Provide credentials

Try logging in Local sql server management studio 
Create Database (CompanyDB) 
Create Table


Deploying SQL Server using PaaS
Paas service - Cloud service manages the service 
                       -Cloud Provider maintain and manage the service
		       - Just require proper configuration

Create -> Sql Server -> (vwpasssql)
->Firewall Yes
->In this case Azure created a new named instance.. that’s y it is fast

Create Database inside sql server created 
Configure DB : depending on your app needs -> Basic for Practice
Backup : Depending on how critical your data is -> Locally redundant 
+Add pot endpoints ( we will do it later on)

—

Firewall settings 

Now retry connecting 

Can create tables on azure portal -> DB -> query editor and write and execute queries
OR SSMS on local machine 

Connection Strings —> JDBC for Java -> 
Databasse synchronisation -> 

__>Sql server
->firewall 
We can create secondary server (failover) 
Changes to Primary server will be replicated to your secondary server.

Develop Solutions using Cosmos DB Storage

Azure Cosmos DB 
Cosmo:: multimodel

Types of NoSQL Db: Documents(mongo-db, elastic), Key-value, Graph(Neo4), Column oriented DB(AWS)
Data Migration is easy 

—we require a cosmos db account 
Create resource -> Databases-> Cosmos DB->Create->
API > Core(SQL)
Notebook(Off) - big data analytics 
Capacity mode-> 
Connectivity method: all n/w
Deployment…Overview-> 
Database is called as container here 
Data Explorer allow us to use DB graphically 
Default consistency




Add container ->new Database

———
Azure Functions 
Independent unit of code
Event triggering the fn event -> timer event
Storage triggers-> blob trigger -

Create Res-> Function App -> 
1 Function can have multiple fns 
Its like a billing unit .

Its name has to be globally unique
Select runtime stack and enviroment

Next -> Hosting 
Storage account : create new
Plan type  :
App service plan (if my app service plan is active then I will be charged)
Premium gives isolated virtual machines
Dedicated physical machines.
Consumption : 
Chose serverless fr practice 
Application insights is about the logging 
—>Create

-Go to resource 
Functions inside the Function app created
+Add 
We will be directed to a blade showing many options 
Http Trigger, Timer trigger etc
Http trigger ->new fn Helloworldfunc

Auth level -> fn->need to have api key associated
Admin -> restricts the users 
Anonymous->just by using the URL path someone can access
Function(selected) 
Code+Test -> check the method

Storage
These terms comes in mind when we use term storage
Databases,
Filess,Objects,Logs,Secrets…

All these can be called as Data.

TO work with Storage services we need “Storage Account”.

BLOB(Binary Large Objects)

How to create a Storage account
Create Resource-> Storage account->
Globally unique name 

BlobStorage :: entirely optimised for blobs only..
StorageV2 (other data not only blob)
Blob access tier:: Cool no cache 
Hot : cache

DIff b/w Blobs and Files
Adv of Blob over Files
Files-> Raw files-> have to work with streams ->I/O
Stored like a File System

Blobs->Objects-> I can directly read write I/O , streams not necessary.

Load Balancing
Outbound Rule.
Configure IIS now

Run this command on power shell of all 3 VMs

# install IIS server role Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools 
# remove default htm file remove-item C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm
# Add a new htm file that displays server name Add-Content -Path "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm" -Value $("Hello World from " + $env:computername)

Installation done on all 3 VMS

Check for public IP in LB
Copy public IP 

Stop vm3
Status Deallocating 
When vm3 is closed it will redirect to fallback VM -1 

VM-1 closed —> response is coming from Vm2 

SCALABLE SOL is provided 
All 3 went down so service unavailable
