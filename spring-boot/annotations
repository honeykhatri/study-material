ANNOTATIONS

The primary annotations that Spring Boot offers reside in its org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure and its sub-packages.

1. @SpringBootApplication
   Equivalent to using 
                   - @Configuration,
                   - @EnableAutoConfiguration & 
                   - @ComponentScan 
                   with their default attributes
        
   Spring boot enables developers to use a single annoation instead of using multiple.
   
   
   
2. @ComponentScan 
   Spring boot application scans all the beans and package declarations when the application initializes. You need to add @ComponentScan annotation
   to  your class file to scan your components added to the project.
   
  
  
3. @RestController - combination of @Controller & @ResponseBody, used for creating rest controller
                   - converts response to JSON or XML
                   - It Ensures that data returned by each method will be written straight into response body instead of returning a template.
                   
             @Controller vs @RestController
                   - Controllers maps the object to view or template and it make it human readable.
                   - Restcontroller returns the object & object data directly to the HTTP response as JSON or XML
