Spring boot : Java based spring framework used for Rapid Application Development
              Extra support for auto configuration & embedded application server like tomcat,jetty.
              
              
Features of Spring boot application

1. Creates stand alone web application with minimal auto configuration.
2. Embedded tomcat, jetty which makes it code and run the application
3. Provide production ready features like health check , metrics and externalized configuration.
4. Absolutely no requirement for XML Configuration.



Advantages of Spring boot

1. Easy to understand and develop spring applications.
2. It is nothing just a existing framework with the addition of embeeded HTTP server and annotation configuration which makes it easier understand
   and faster the process of development.
3. Increases productivity and reduces development time.
4. Minimal configuration
5. We dont need to write XML configuration only a few annotations are required.



FOUR Key components of Spring Boot

1. Spring boot Auto Configuration
2. Spring boot CLI
3. Spring boot Actuators
4. Spring boot starter POMs



Spring boot vs Spring??

Following are the keypoints which spring boot offers but spring doesn't
1. Strater POM.
2. Spring boot actuators
3. Component scanning 
4. Auto configuration
5. Version management
6. Embedded server
7. InMemory DB


STARTER dependency of Spring boot?
Starter Dependencies: Spring boot starter is a maven template that has collection of relavant transitive depencies that are needed to start a particular functionaliy

Like if we need to import spring-boot-web-starter dependecny for creating a web application
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

Spring boot offers number of started dependencies,few of them are listed below
1. Web starter
2. Data JPA starter
3. Test starter
4. Thymeleaf starter
5. Mail starter
6. Security starter


HOW SPRING BOOT WORKS?
Spring boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project. 
The entry point of the spring boot application is the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication and have a main method.
Spring boot automatically scans all the componrents in the project using @ComponentScan annotation.

- How it starts?
  Just like any other java program, spring boot application must have a main method. This method is the entry point of the application, which invokes
  SpringApplication#run  method to bootstrap the application
  
  @SpringBootApplication
  public class MainClass{
  public static void main(String[] args){
  SpringApplication.run(MainClass.class);
  //other statements
  }
  }
  
  Spring Boot CLI : Command line interface that allow you to create spring-based applications in Groovy.
